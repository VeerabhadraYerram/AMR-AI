# AMR Intelligence Platform: One Health Surveillance Framework

## Overview

The AMR Intelligence Platform is an AI-enabled computational framework designed to support **One Health Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) surveillance** in the Indian context. 

This platform integrates genomic and phenotypic data across multiple sectors (Human, Animal, Food) to:
1.  **Quantify** the antimicrobial resistance burden.
2.  **Compare** resistance determinants across host types.
3.  **Infer** transmission pathways using resistance pattern clustering and similarity matrices.

## 🔬 Scientific Positioning

This project is a macroscopic surveillance and modeling system. 

**What we DO:**
*   Quantify resistance prevalence and Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR) burden.
*   Model cross-sector gene similarity.
*   Infer transmission networks using computational resistance pattern clustering.
*   Utilize de-identified retrospective hospital data alongside public animal/food datasets.

**What we DO NOT DO:**
*   We do not predict individual clinical outcomes or provide patient treatment recommendations.
*   We do not claim confirmed epidemiological transmission (e.g., via contact tracing). All pathways are computational inferences based on shared resistance determinants.
*   We do not estimate mortality or economic burden.

## 🏗 System Architecture & Capabilities

The platform is built around a robust Intelligence Core designed to demonstrate methodological soundness for surveillance:

### 1. Data Harmonization
*   Standardizes diverse metadata including Host-Type (Human, Animal, Food), sample year, and Ward/ICU.

### 2. Analytical Intelligence Core
*   **Prevalence Calculation:** Dynamic computation of resistance rates.
*   **MDR Classification:** Automated tagging of Multi-Drug Resistant isolates based on standardized guidelines.
*   **Host-Stratified Burden:** Comparative analysis of resistance across different sectors.
*   **Similarity Matrices:** Measuring the genetic and phenotypic overlap across hosts.
*   **Clustering & Network Inference:** Utilizing algorithms like DBSCAN to group similar resistance profiles and generate network adjacencies for transmission inference.

### 3. Statistical Validation Layer
*   Ensures scientific rigor through bootstrapping for prevalence confidence intervals, sensitivity analysis, and cross-dataset validation for clustering robustness.

## 📈 Intended Use & Limitations

This system is explicitly designed for public health researchers and policymakers to identify high-probability AMR reservoirs and directional trends across sectors.

**Explicit Limitations:**
*   **Inferred Transmission:** The transmission networks generated by this framework are *computational inferences*. They represent shared genetic/phenotypic markers, not confirmed direct transmission events.
*   **Data Caveats:** Findings are heavily dependent on the completeness, quality, and specific sampling biases of the underlying retrospective hospital and public datasets.

## 💻 Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Pandas, Scikit-Learn
*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Recharts
*   **Data Processing:** Custom Python pipelines for data harmonization and ML inference.
